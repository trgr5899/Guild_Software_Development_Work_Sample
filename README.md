# Guild Education Software Development Work Sample
This is my work sample for the Guild Education software development internship. I did full stack development of a course registration website using a micro web framework written in Python called flask and a SQL toolkit/object-relational mapper for Python called SQLAlchemy.

In your terminal type the following commands

```bash
pip install -r flask
```

```bash
pip install -r Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

```bash
pip install -r flask-login
```

## How to run the app

```bash
python main.py
```
